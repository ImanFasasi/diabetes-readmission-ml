Data Cleaning and Transformation Summary:

1. Removed duplicates based on 'encounter_id'.
2. Standardized categorical variables:
   - 'readmitted': Mapped to 'Readmitted' and 'Not Readmitted'.
   - 'change': Standardized to 'Change' and 'No Change'.
   - 'weight': Transformed to binary flag: 'Weight Provided' or 'Unknown'.
3. Replaced missing values and standardized 'admission_type_id' using IDS_mapping.
4. Flagged outliers in numerical fields (e.g., 'time_in_hospital') using IQR method.
5. Replaced outlier values with column medians for consistency.
6. Validated logical consistency between:
   - 'admission_type_id' and 'admission_source_id'.
   - 'time_in_hospital' and complexity indicators.
7. Exported cleaned datasets for analysis.
